# Project-5-AEEM
Automated Experiment Execution Manager created by Dre Woolston, Mark Thompson, Miah Weems, and Quinn Scrivner

# How to Start Experiments
**FIRST** `python run.py`

The user will then be prompted to input the number of kernels that experiments will be run on. 

Next, the user will be prompted to enter the file paths for each kernel.

Then, the user will be prompted for the number of experiments to run on each kernel.

Lastly, the user will be prompted for the type of Benchmark being ran. 

The program will then start a timer and then reboot and begin the experiments.
